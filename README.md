## Background
The Regina Mandolin Orchestra (RMO) is a democratic, member run, nonprofit ensemble. They currently have a [website](http://mandolin.ca) that is functional, but that they want to be improved.

## Problem Statement
The RMO's member's only section is currently unintuitive and hard to use. It is also lacking in distribution and administrative features that could help better organize it's members.

## Our Three Solution Pillars
- User Experience
- Information Distrobution
- Account Control
